**Medical Image Detection App**

**Project Overview:-**

This project is an AI-powered application that helps detect medical conditions from images. It uses a machine learning model to analyze and classify medical images, assisting healthcare professionals with diagnostics. The app is built with Streamlit, making it easy to use with a simple interface for uploading images and getting real-time predictions. It is powered by the Gemini Pro 1.5 API, which improves accuracy and efficiency in image analysis.

**Key Features:-**
- Streamlit Web App: A fully interactive web-based application for medical image detection.
- Gemini Pro 1.5 API Integration: Uses Google's AI model for advanced image analysis.
- Image Upload & Analysis: Users can upload medical images for AI-based detection.
- User-friendly Interface: Simple and interactive UI using Streamlit.
- Visualization Tools: Displays input images and highlights key diagnostic areas.

**Technical Highlights:-**
- Machine Learning Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- Technologies Used:
  - Streamlit for web-based interface.
  - Python for backend processing.
  - Gemini Pro 1.5 API for enhanced image detection capabilities.
 
**How to Use:-**
- Visit the live app: https://medical-image-detection-app-sjdlztehefcybcp9u2v5bp.streamlit.app/
- Upload a medical image by dragging and dropping it into the upload section or clicking "Browse files."
- Click on Generate the Analysis to process the image.
- The AI model, powered by Gemini Pro 1.5, will analyze the image and provide a diagnosis.

**Findings:-**

The app generates a structured medical image analysis based on the following approach:
- Detailed Analysis: Each uploaded medical image is thoroughly examined to identify any abnormalities or signs of disease.
- Findings Report: The app provides a structured report highlighting all observed anomalies or potential health issues.
- Recommendations & Next Steps: Based on the analysis, the app suggests possible further tests or medical procedures.
- Treatment Suggestions: If applicable, the AI model provides possible treatment recommendations.

**Important Notes:-**
- The AI only provides analysis for human medical images.
- If the image quality is poor, the app will indicate that certain aspects are "Unable to be determined based on the provided image."
- The analysis includes the disclaimer: "Consult with a Doctor before making any decisions."

**Future Work:-**
- Implement a feedback loop for model improvement.
- Develop a mobile-friendly version for easy accessibility.
- Expand detection to multiple medical conditions.
- Improve Streamlit app features for better user experience.
